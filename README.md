# Contributing & Translations
Development initially started when I was learning Swift/SwiftUI/UIKIt so the codebase is very undocumented & hacky in some places (thanks a ton SwiftUI). If you have any questions feel free to ask them over on our discord's Development related channels or through Issues or Discussions here. :]


App-Wide Translations are planned and as the user base grows, it will become a core priority.
